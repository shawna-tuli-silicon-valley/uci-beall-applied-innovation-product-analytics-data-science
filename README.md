"I was lucky enough to mentor Shawna as my intern at the UCI Beall Applied Innovation ("Cove") startup incubator. My team onboarded many innovative startups like DocBot, Syntr, and Kolkin into our incubator at their very early stages. Even then, Shawna has demonstrated a natural facility with and understanding of the importance of both the technical software engineering side and the people and business side of technology ventures. She is a self starter able to dig into and figure out ambiguous things with a focus on delivering usable outcomes like the time she took random data to deliver progress insights on our cohort of incubator startups at the Cove. I am proud of her and her successes in her career since and look forward to many more." - Mark Mandau (Sr. Technical Product Manager (of Product Managers))
